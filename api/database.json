Ay, where are they?\n  Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,--\nWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\n  And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;\nThen in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn\n  Among the river sallows, borne aloft\n    Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;\nAnd full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\n  Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft\n  The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,",
